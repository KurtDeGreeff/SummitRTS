# SummitRTS
SummitRTS is an automation Framework that offers a Provisioning service and task execution engine, capable of software installation, machine or software configuration, upgrade/patch applications, security testing, troubleshooting networks and more. SummitRTS leverages common API's to control and interact with virtual machines to significantly speed up and stabilize functions for software development, testing, system administration, security, networking and similar projects. Removing the human element and utilizing the 'set it and forget it' approach, Belay's SummitRTS allows for increased productivity and reliability of results, as well as reduced labor costs. 


The SummitRTS framework is capable of quickly executing multiple actions against a matrix of Operating Systems, versions, patch levels, languages and applications with no user interaction. The Developer/Tester/System Administrator selects the environment and the test plan, SummitRTS handles everything else from the provisioning of a clean testing environment, to the installation and configuration of software, to the execution of the test plan, reverting to original state and publishing of the results to the User Interface.

## Why Use the SummitRTS Framework?
* To save Time and Money!  

## Who would use the SummitRTS Framework?
* System Administrators  
* Software Developers  
* Testers (of any kind, Software, security, network)  
* Security (offensive or defensive minded)  
* IT Management  

## What would you use the SummitRTS Framework for?
* System administrators can use this framework to automate the testing of any scripts they use to manage machines on their network. It could include things like installing software, patching/updating machines, Configuration of machines, software upgrades, policy changes, account changes, etc.  

* Software developers can use SummitRTS to test their software, whether it be the installation of their software, upgrade of their software, or utilization of their software in multiple environments.  

* Testers can use SummitRTS to help them automate and test in a clean repeatable environment.  Device can be used to mimick Key strokes and Mouse clicks, so its very powerful.  

* Security would be able to test their offensive and defensive techniques in a clean/repeatable environment.  

* Management in general should be interested in the above mentioned people performing those tasks as well as the following scenario...  If this "thing" (anything) happens on my network, what happens to my other "things".  Did your Application crash? Network crash?  So basically a test range/network/virtual machine etc, and the idea being that you force something bad to happen, and can see what else it effects. So SummitRTS (eventually) could build a network, and if on that network I have a machine that reboots, or shuts down, how does that affect other things on my network.
